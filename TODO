Misc
----

Make everything faster :)
The EXIF parser is way to slow

Add more types and information.

Create a README

Update inline docs

Move external submodules like eyeD3 and the discID code to an extra
dir lib to serperate our code from external modules we just copy.

Create doc in the Wiki and dump it into the doc subdir

Add list of external files kaa.beacon should know about

Make bitrate kbit/s

If possible, attributes should match
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fshared_2dfilemetadata_2dspec
and mime type should match

Attributes overhaul
-------------------

Many of the core attributes are poorly named or redundant.  There is a new tags
interface introduced with the Matroska parser that other parsers should make
use if, in lieu of assigning to core attributes.

In general, all parsers should model the Matroska parser in terms of what
attributes are core and which are left to tags, since Matroska is fairly well
specified and sensible.

Also date-related attributes/tags need to be thoroughly reviewed.  Parsers
should ensure they are well-formed (preferably according to the Matroska spec).
Ideally they would be exposed as datetime objects, but datetime objects can't
express partial dates (e.g. just year) so that will need to be thought out.

Core attributes that survive should be converted to properties with docstrings.
